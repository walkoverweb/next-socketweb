**Create a Project**

Create a dedicated project for each purpose or service. For example, [MSG91](https://msg91.com/) has multiple services like Hello, Campaign, CDP, ChatBot so they created 4 projects for each of them because they want Embed to behave differently in their each service.

  Using the **window.addEventListener('message')**, shown in the above SDK image, you can get the valuable information about a particular flow when any action is performed by the user in the below format.

  * "**action**" will show the status about a flow.

    1. "initiated" : This will show if the flow is created for the first time or has not been published yet.
    2. "published" : This action will tell user that the flow has been published.
    3. "deleted" : This is for when the flow gets deleted.
  * "**description**" will tell us about what this flow does.
  * "**id**" is a unique flow identifier.
  * "**webhookurl**" is flow invocation URL.
  * "**payload**" : It consist the payload which is used to hit the webhookurl of flow.
